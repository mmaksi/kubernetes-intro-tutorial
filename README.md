# kubernetes-intro-tutorial
Welcome to the introduction to Kubernetes tutorial. Please refer to my YouTube video [] and my hashnode blog [] to follow along.

## Prerequisites
1. Having a basse knowledge of how to build a server in your language of choice. The tutorial is in JavaScript and uses Express.js as a framework.
2. No need to be familiar with Docker, but I expect you to know what Docker is and why it is used.
3. Open mind for learning. :)

> Please note that working in a language different than JavaScript requires you to change the `Dockerfile` to suit your needs.
